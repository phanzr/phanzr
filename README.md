### Hi there 👋
+1 year of experience as a frontend developer, combining UX/UI design skills with the experience gained through personal and social projects.
Looking for new challenges and the opportunity to join a growing collaborative team, where I can contribute with my knowledge, and thus achieve the purpose of expanding my experience as a full stack developer, committed to learning and continuous improvement.
